(* A lock-free synchronous channel with cancellation, using Cells.

   Producers and consumers are paired off and then the producer transfers its
   value to the consumer. This is effectively a bounded queue with a capacity
   of zero.

   Both producers and consumers can cancel while waiting.

   There is an atomic int ([balance]), plus two queues ([consumers] and
   [producers]) made using Cells. When [balance] is positive, it is the number
   of producers waiting with values that no one is yet responsible for
   resuming. When negative, it is the (negative) number of waiting consumers
   that no one is responsible for resuming.

   To put an item:

   1. The producer increments [balance].
   2. If it was negative, the producer resumes one waiting consumer on the [consumers] queue.
      Otherwise, it suspends itself on the [producers] queue.

   To take an item:

   1. The consumer decrements [balance].
   2. If it was positive, the consumer resumes one waiting producer on the [producers] queue.
      Otherwise, it suspends itself on the [consumers] queue.

   Therefore, we never try to resume on a queue unless another party has
   started the process of suspending on it.

   The system will not become idle while a client is responsible for resuming
   something. Therefore, when idle:

   - If [balance <= 0] then there are no waiting producers.
   - If [balance >= 0] then there are no waiting consumers.
   - So, we never have waiting consumers and producers at the same time.

   As usual with Cells, either party may get to the new cell first. Whichever party
   arrives first writes a callback, which the other party will then call when they arrive.

   Note on terminology:

   - The "suspender" of a cell is the party that incremented the queue's suspend index,
     and the "resumer" of a cell is the party that incremented the resume index.

   - Whether "suspending" or "resuming" a cell, you may still have to suspend
     your fiber and resume it later.

   States

   There are four cell states:

   - [In_transition] indicates that the cell is still being initialised, or might be
     getting cancelled. Either way, the suspending party is actively working to
     change the cell's state.

   - [Item] indicates that the producer is ready to provide an item.

   - [Slot] indicates that the consumer is ready to receive an item.

   - [Finished] indicates that the cell is no longer being used (the value has
     been consumed or the cell has finished being cancelled).

   The possible sequences of states on the [producers] queue are:

   In_transition -C> Slot -P> Finished    (consumer arrives first)
                 `P> Item -C> Finished    (producer arrives first)
                          `P> In_transition -P> Finished   (producer cancels)
                                            `C> Slot -P> Finished   (cancellation interrupted)

   Only the producer can cancel here. For the [consumers] queue it's the
   opposite - the consumer can cancel its [Slot].

   Cancellation

   Note that there are two kinds of cancellation here:

   1. A cancelled cell is not considered part of its queue. Anyone seeing one
      (due to a race) will skip over it and use the next cell.

   2. After a consumer and producer have been paired off (and the cell removed
      from its queue), the consumer callback may reject the value. If this
      happens, the producer must start all over again to find another consumer.

   Whenever a consumer sets its callback to reject values, it should then start
   the process of cancelling its cell (if acting as a suspender) so that the
   cell can be GC'd.

   A consumer can only cancel its cell when it's on the [consumers] queue.
   If it's on [producers], it knows a wake up will be coming shortly anyway.
   A consumer cancels its cell as follows:

   1. The consumer sets its cell in [consumers] to [In_transition].
   2. It increments [balance] (from a negative value). It is now committed to cancelling.
   3. It sets its cell to [Finished].

   (1) will fail if the cell got resumed first. In that case the consumer just
   rejects the cancellation attempt.

   (2) will fail if [balance >= 0]. In that case the consumer has not cancelled,
   and is about to be resumed instead. It tries to return to the [Slot] state.
   If that fails, the cell now contains an Item and the consumer takes it.

   (3) will fail if a producer arrived after the consumer committed to cancelling.
   In that case, the consumer passes the Item on to the next consumer (there
   must be another one, since both the consumer and producer incremented
   [balance] from a negative value).

   Cancelling a producer is very similar to cancelling a consumer, just with the
   [producers] queue and decrementing the balance from a positive value.

   Non-blocking take

   To perform a non-blocking take:

   1. The consumer decrements [balance] from a positive number.
   2. The consumer takes the next resume cell from [producers].
   3. The consumer takes the [Item] from the cell, setting it to [Finished].

   (1) will fail if there are no unassigned items available.
   Then the [take_nonblocking] returns [None], as there are no items waiting.

   (3) will fail if the producer is initialising or cancelling. In either case,
   the consumer sets its cell to a request with a dummy callback that rejects
   all values and continues immediately.

   The exchange

   Once a producer and consumer have been paired off (and so their cell is now Finished),
   the producer's value is passed to the consumer's callback. If the consumer accepts it,
   then both fibers are resumed. If not, the producer starts again (incrementing [balance]
   again) and waits for another consumer.

   The above has not been formally verified (exercise for reader!). *)
